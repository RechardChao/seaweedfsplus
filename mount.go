	Short:     "mount weed filer to a directory as file system in userspace(FUSE)",
	Long: `mount weed filer to userspace.

  Pre-requisites:
  1) have SeaweedFS master and volume servers running
  2) have a "weed filer" running
  These 2 requirements can be achieved with one command "weed server -filer=true"

  This uses bazil.org/fuse, whichenables writing FUSE file systems on
  Linux, and OS X.

  On OS X, it requires OSXFUSE (http://osxfuse.github.com/).
